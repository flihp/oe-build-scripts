oe-build-scripts
================

This is a set of build scripts that I use to build OE images.
It also contains the infrastructure common to other projects like scripts to pull in additonal meta layers but it doesn't these facilities itself (see LAYERS).
There are a number of branches, each of which is specialized to build a specific project / image.
The 'master' branch is a simple template that builds a 'distro-less' generic core-image-minimal.
The 'measured' branch builds the boot image from meta-measured.
The 'selinux' branch builds the minimal selinux image from meta-selinux.
